QUICK START INSTALL ON LINUX
============================

This is known to work on Ubuntu 16.04 through 24.04, but should work
elsewhere with minimal change.


To build:

 ./autogen.sh --enable-sqlite --enable-shmem --enable-debugfile --with-config-file=/opt/nethack/dgamelaunch.conf
 make all


To install (fresh install):

 sudo ./dgl-create-chroot


To update (install new version to an existing chroot):

 # Edit top section of install-to-chroot.sh with local config.
 sudo ./install-to-chroot.sh
